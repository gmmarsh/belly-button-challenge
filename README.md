interactive dashboard

The static file contains two JavaScript files: app.js and bonus.js.
The code in the app.js file contains the JavaScript used to construct the interactive bar chart and bubble chart.
The code in the bonus.js file contains the JavaScript used to construct the interactive gauge.

The template file contains the index.html rendered.

The app.py file uses Flask to create an application that renders the index.html file.

To build the flask application, I referenced Shelley Benhoff's YouTube channel called HoffsTech. In her video entitled 'Flask Python Web Development: Building a Responsive Website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript', Shelley explains to create a Flash app to render an HTML file. She describes how to use the render template method. This is the method that I used.
